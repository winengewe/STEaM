GigaWatt-Hour Subsurface Thermal Energy storAge: Engineered structures and legacy Mine shafts: STEaM

Objectives:
To investigate the potential for Mine Shaft Thermal Energy Storage (MSTES) to deliver low-cost renewable district heating and support balancing of the future renewable electricity grid. 
The approach taken has been:
•	Key knowledge was extracted from the relevant literature.
•	A case study and scenarios were defined.
•	Concepts were developed for MSTES integration, and KPIs proposed.
•	A model of MSTES integration into district heating and renewable grid was developed.
•	The model and case study were used to deliver insights into potential performance. 
•	The viability of MSTES in a future renewable grid was discussed.
